    <p class="description"><h2>Description</h2>
    Tacos de canasta translates in English as "basket tacos," 
    which perfectly describes how they're transported and 
    served. To make them, you'll fill your tacos individually,
    as usual. Then you'll pack them in a plastic bag coated 
    with a chile-infused oil, where they'll steam on their 
    own and keep warm until you're ready to eat them. 
    They're also sometimes called tacos sudados (sweaty!).

    </ul></p>
    <p><h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Make the First Filling</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
        <li>Slice the onion crosswise.</li>
        <li>Slice off the stems and tops off the jalapeños, 
            slice them in half lengthwise, and remove the seeds 
            and veins. Then slice them crosswise</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            When the oil shimmers, add the onion and jalapeño 
            and cook until soft</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes and cook, pressing with a spatula, 
            until they are completely mashed. Add salt and stir 
            to incorporate</li>
        <li>Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Wipe out the skillet</li>
    </ol>
     <h3>Making the Second Filling</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
            <li>Heat the vegetable oil (in the same skillet used
                for the first filling) over medium-low heat. When the oil
                shimmers, add the onion and garlic and cook until they 
                begin to soften</li>
            <li>Add the beans with the liquid in the can and cook, 
                pressing with a spatula until they are mostly mashed. 
                Add salt and stir to incorporate. Set aside</li>
        </ol> 
        <h3>Make the Salsa</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot filled with water to a boil. Add the 
                tomatillos and cook until the skins begin to peel, about
                30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and let cool</li>
            <li>Remove and discard the skins</li>
            <li>To a blender, add the prepared tomatillos, garlic, 
                onion, and cilantro, and salt to taste. Blend until 
                mostly pureed, but still slightly chunky</li>
            <li>Fold in the avocado. Adjust the seasoning with salt. 
                Transfer to a bowl</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Build the tacos</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Line the basket with a large bath towel. Place the 
                plastic bag on top of the towel. Line the inside of 
                the plastic bag with parchment or waxed paper</li>
            <li>Heat about 1 1/4 cups vegetable oil in a large skillet 
                over medium-high heat. Add the ground achiote and stir 
                to dissolve in the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer, 
                dip each tortilla into the hot, seasoned oil and fry 
                lightly, about 3 seconds per side (they should lightly 
                fried, but still soft and foldable, not crispy). Transfer 
                to a paper-towel-lined rimmed baking sheet. Reserve the 
                oil in the skillet</li>
            <li>Fill 10 tacos with the potato filling. Fold in half. 
                Fill the remaining 10 tacos with the bean filling. 
                Fold in half. Transfer to the plastic bag with the oil
                as noted above. Tightly close the plastic bag once all
                the tacos are assembled. Fold the towel over the top of
                 the plastic bag to keep the tacos warm. If necessary, 
                 add more towels on top to keep the tacos insulated</li>
            <li>Serve the tacos with the salsa. If you're not eating them 
                all at once, keep the rest in the bag, covered with the 
                towel</li>
        </ol>
